## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I'm starting to get familiar with position and display property, since now I'm able to use them to display my webpage elements in a certain order. This challenge seems pretty easy, however, it is important to understand the position and display property to fully understand what's going on with the elements in our project.
